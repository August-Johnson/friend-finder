# WEEK 13 HOMEWORK - FRIEND FINDER

<p>This week's homework assignment was to build a friend finder app, using JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js and Heroku. The app will have the user fill out a survey and then match them with the person whose answer's were the closest to their own. It will display the match by using a modal to show the name and picture of the person. The app had to be deployed using Heroku.</p>

## CHALLENGES

* Working with different JavaScript files that handle unique functions, and then connecting and referencing them together.
* Getting the modal to behave properly was a bit annoying.
